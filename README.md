# Big--Data-Analytics-2
A collection of BDA Homeworks
Tools Used: Python(Matplotlib, Sklearn)

Problem Statement:

Visualization using the iris dataset.  

Compute the distances between data points for the iris data set (iris.data). 

a. Read the iris data and form a data matrix X of size 150x4

b. Normalize X, using the mean of attribute and standard deviation of attribute

c. Compute the distance matrix between pairs of data using the following metrics:

  i.Euclideandistance
  
  ii.Cosine distance = 1 - Cosine_similarity
  
  iii.Mahalanobis Distance
  
d. Plot the above distance matrices using python's matplotlib package and matshow to plot a matrix

e.Using the proximity measureyou developed in 2(b) compute the proximity between data belonging to the same class.  Express the proximity as a symmetric 3x3 matrix(for distances between the threeclasses).  Do this using all three distance metrics in(c).Discuss your results.

Approach:

Achieved the problem statement solution by using MatplotLib, Sklearn packages for computing distances in Python.
